Despite being part of a young generation of Palestinian Arabs whose families chose to stay and challenge the Israeli state after Al-Nakba, 17-year-old Tamer and his friends are just like any other group of teenage boys.
 They clumsily search for drugs, flirt with girls, play video games, and slack off at school.
 However, when a beautiful new student named Maysaa’ joins their class Tamer immediately falls for her and, 
by association, is drawn into her political activism. Together they join fellow classmate,
 Safwat, in an operation to covertly raise the Palestinian flag and peacefully disrupt the local
 celebrations planned for Israel’s Independence Day – otherwise known to Palestinians as a day of 
mourning and memorialization for their displacement 70 years prior. Unsure of his own political convictions,
 Tamer must quickly determine what matters to him and what price he is willing to pay for freedom.
